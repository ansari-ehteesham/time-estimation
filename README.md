# Time Estimation from Analog Clock Images

This project implements a deep learning pipeline to estimate the time displayed on an analog clock from its image. The project uses synthetic data generation, thorough preprocessing, and a regression model built on a ResNet50 backbone with custom layers to predict the hour, minute, and second.

## Overview

The goal is to predict the time (hour, minute, and second) from an analog clock image. Our approach involves:

- **Data Generation:**  
  Synthetic analog clock images are generated programmatically, simulating a variety of conditions (e.g., different clock designs, backgrounds, and lighting).
  
- **Dataset Split:**  
  The generated dataset is split into:
  - 70% Training
  - 15% Validation
  - 15% Test

- **Model Architecture:**  
  - **Backbone:** Pre-trained ResNet50 (initialized with ImageNet weights).
  - **Regression Head:** Custom dense layers that output three values corresponding to hour, minute, and second.
  
- **Custom Loss Function:**  
  We use a cyclic time loss function that accounts for the circular nature of time:
  
  ```python
  def cyclic_time_loss(y_true, y_pred):
      # Convert time values to radians
      true_time = y_true * [2 * np.pi / 12, 2 * np.pi / 60, 2 * np.pi / 60]
      pred_time = y_pred * [2 * np.pi / 12, 2 * np.pi / 60, 2 * np.pi / 60]
      # Compute sine of half the angular difference
      return tf.reduce_mean(tf.abs(tf.sin((true_time - pred_time) / 2)))
  ```
  
  **Explanation:**  
  - Hours are scaled by 2π/12 (12-hour cycle)  
  - Minutes/seconds are scaled by 2π/60 (60-minute/60-second cycle)  
  - Uses `sin((difference)/2)` to measure angular distance on a unit circle  
  - Mean absolute error of these sinusoidal differences becomes the loss

- **Metrics:**  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for hours, minutes, and seconds  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) for reference

## Process Workflow

1. **Data Generation** (`notebooks/data_generation.ipynb`):  
   - Create synthetic clock images with randomized:
     - Clock designs (hand lengths/styles, numbers vs. markers)
   - Save images with timestamp labels in `raw/`

2. **Preprocessing** (`notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb`):  
   - Resize images to 224x224 (ResNet50 input size)
   - Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
   - Split data into train/validation/test sets (70/15/15)
   - Apply augmentations: rotations, brightness adjustments, noise injection

3. **Data Ingestion** (`notebooks/data_ingestion.ipynb`):  
   - Load Data into Database (in this project Database is our folder on disk)

4. **Model Training** (`notebooks/model_training.ipynb`):  
   - Build model:  
     ```python
     base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, pooling='avg')
     outputs = Dense(3, activation='linear')(base_model.output)
     model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=outputs)
     ```
   - Train with:
     - Loss: `cyclic_time_loss`
     - Metrics: MAE for hours/minutes/seconds
     - Early stopping based on validation loss
   - Save best model to `model/best_clock_model.h5`

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ansari-ehteesham/time-estimation
cd time-estimation
```

### 2. Setup Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
env\Scripts\activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Generate Data
1. Open `notebooks/data_generation.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Execute all cells to create synthetic dataset

### 4. Preprocess Data
1. Open `notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb`
2. Run all cells to process and augment images
3. It is also used to split Dataset

### 5. Prepare Datasets
1. Run `notebooks/data_ingestion.ipynb` to add data into a database

### 6. Train Model
1. Execute `notebooks/model_training.ipynb` to:
   - Build and compile model
   - Start training (view live metrics)
   - Save best model checkpoint

### 7. Inference
Load the trained model for predictions:
```python
model = load_model('artifacts/best_clock_model.h5', custom_objects={'cyclic_time_loss': cyclic_time_loss})
img = load_and_preprocess('your_image.jpg')
predicted_time = model.predict(img[np.newaxis, ...])[0]  # [hour, minute, second]
```

## Key Features

- **Cyclic-Aware Training**: The custom loss function handles circular time continuity (e.g., 11:59 PM to 12:00 AM is a 1-minute difference, not 23h59m).
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages ResNet50's pretrained weights for robust feature extraction.
- **Synthetic Data Engine**: Programmatic generation allows unlimited training variations.

## Future Improvements

- Add second hand detection
- Handle occluded/damaged clocks
- Support low-light/nighttime images


Key improvements:
1. Removed LaTeX formulas for GitHub compatibility
2. Added concrete implementation details (e.g., ResNet50 initialization)
3. Fixed directory structure formatting
4. Added inference code example
5. Clarified Jupyter notebook execution steps
6. Added license/maintainer section
7. Improved technical explanations while maintaining readability
